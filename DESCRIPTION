Description: R-RerF (aka Randomer Forest (RerF) or Random Projection
  Forests) is an algorithm developed by Tomita (2016) <arXiv:1506.03410v2>
  which is similar to Random Forest - Random Combination (Forest-RC)
  developed by Breiman (2001) <doi:10.1023/A:1010933404324>.  Random
  Forests create axis-parallel, or orthogonal trees. That is, the feature
  space is recursively split along directions parallel to the axes of the
  feature space. Thus, in cases in which the classes seem inseparable
  along any single dimension, Random Forests may be suboptimal.  To
  address this, Breiman also proposed and characterized Forest-RC, which
  uses linear combinations of coordinates rather than individual
  coordinates, to split along.  This package, 'rerf', implements RerF
  which is similar to Forest-RC.  The difference between the two
  algorithms is where the random linear combinations occur: Forest-RC
  combines features at the per tree level whereas RerF takes linear
  combinations of coordinates at every node in the tree.
